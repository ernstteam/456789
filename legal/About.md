# Communication is critical.
# Privacy is essential.

Raaees is currently led by [ITS RAEES](https://raaees.com).

> "From your first dirt block, to the greatest guild you have ever played with, to late-night deep conversations with your friends, we all know how important communication is.
>
> We at Raaees strive to create a free  platform, allowing diversified communities of all kinds to thrive and to be fully transparent with our users. We believe everyone should have total freedom over how they talk with each other.
>
> We realize these days that privacy has come down lower in priority amongst other values. We believe in freedom of speech, that everyone should have the right to talk freely and express themselves in any way."
